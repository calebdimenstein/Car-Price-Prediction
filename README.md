# Car-Price-Prediction
Research conducted on cars sold in the California car market to predict used car prices. Data was collected from Kaggle's US Used Cars Dataset and filtered in site so data download would be manageable. This group research project was part of graduate level coursework in which the desired goal was to apply data mining techniques (supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, machine learning algorithms, and ensemble model implementation) to create and solve a mock business problem. The car price prediction model is intended to be utilized by a car dealership trying to break into the California market.

The paper writting is based off of the two python scripts in this repository. One script cleans the data while the other performs the modeling needed for our findings.
